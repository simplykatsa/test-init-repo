### Initializing a GitHub Repository

After completing the [Contact Us Tutorial](https://documentation.platformos.com/get-started/contact-us-tutorial/) and having the code on your local machine, the next step is to create a GitHub repository and connect it to your local project. This will help you manage your code, collaborate with others, and keep track of changes.

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. **Log in to GitHub**:
   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in to your account. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free.

2. **Create a New Repository**:
   - Click the **+** icon in the top right corner and select **New repository**.
   - Enter a **Repository name**. For example, `contact-us-tutorial`.
   - Optionally, add a **Description**.
   - Choose the repository to be **Public** or **Private**.
   - **Do not** initialize the repository with a README, .gitignore, or license. We'll handle this locally.
   - Click **Create repository**.

#### Step 2: Initialize Git Locally

1. **Open Terminal**:
   Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows).

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   Change the directory to where your project is located. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

3. **Initialize Git**:
   Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. **Add Files to Staging**:
   Add all your project files to the staging area:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit Your Changes**:
   Commit the files with an appropriate message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

#### Step 3: Connect to GitHub Repository

1. **Add Remote Repository**:
   Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository you created. Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY-NAME` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
   ```

2. **Push Changes to GitHub**:
   Push your local changes to the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

#### Step 4: Verify Your Repository

1. **Check GitHub**:
   Go to your repository on GitHub (https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME) and verify that your files are present and the initial commit is listed.

#### Step 5: Update Your Repository

1. **Make Changes Locally**:
   Make any changes to your code locally as needed.

2. **Add, Commit, and Push Changes**:
   - Stage the changed files:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the changes:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Describe your changes"
     ```
   - Push the changes:
     ```bash
     git push
     ```

Congratulations! You have successfully created a GitHub repository and connected it to your local project. This will make it easier to manage your code, collaborate with others, and keep track of changes as you continue developing with PlatformOS.
